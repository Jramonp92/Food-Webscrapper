# Food-Webscrapper

This is a simple webscrapper I did to try some concepts of webscrapping and selenium.
In this case we are scrapping the website of a well-know delivery app to find all the restaurants that sells pizza in my zone
and save that data in a database.

This was my first approach to Selenium, the structure used is monolithical and it doesn't follow any kind of good practice.
Implicit wait was set to 30seconds instead of using EC.
