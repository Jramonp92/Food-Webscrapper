# Food-Webscrapper

A web scrapper using Python + Selenium WebDriver + Sqlite3

This is a simple webscrapper I did to try some concepts of webscrapping and selenium.
In this case we are scrapping the website of a well-know delivery app to find all the restaurants that sells pizza in my zone
and save that data in a database.

Nothing to big, but it works!
